This program is in all accounts complete.  I was going to make it so you drag the 
magnifying glass over the text, but the click handler was being a bitch and I was 
getting a headache so I quit.  I made this as simple as possible.  F9 hides the glass, 
F10 shows it, the Up key zooms in, the down key out.  Click the blue cross to exit the 
program. Enjoy
